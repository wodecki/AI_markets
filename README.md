## Project details

The goal of this project is to **identify the most interesting patterns in an Artificial Intelligence market** basing on the actual data from index.co: one of the largest databases with information on companies in different markets and locations. 

Thanks to a courtesy of index.co (a daughter company of The Next Web) team, I analyzed a dataset with **+3 000 records of companies describing themselves with "Artificial Intelligence" TAG**. This dataset included information on eg. markets, number of employees, country, headquarters, total investments, latest investment round type and amount.

The dataset allows to answer many interesting questions about **the hottest technologies and markets, investment patterns and employment**. Moreover, it open doors to more advanced machine learning modeling, eg. predicting the investments potential or the most promising location for heaquarters.

## Instructions

All the computations are stored in a `jupyter notebook`. If you don't have it installed, please follow the instructions provided here: https://jupyter.org/install .

Having `jupyter notebook`, you need only 3 python libraries installed: `numpy, pandas` and `folium`.

All can be easily installed using `pip install` command. Eg. to install `folium` type:

`pip install folium`

Next, just open an **AI_markets.ypnb** and run the code cell by cell. Don't hesitate to adopt it to Your needs :)
